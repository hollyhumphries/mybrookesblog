Founded in 2016 *Deciem's The Ordinary*, by Brandon Truaxe, is one of the most popular brands across the skincare industry due to the significantly low price point and its transparency when it comes to ingredients and its effectiveness. Unlike other skincare brands, who make a fortune every year, out of the marketisation of a product focusing on words such as 'glowy skin', 'clear skin', 'targeting acne prone skin', *The Ordinary* pioneered in creating affordable and high quality skincare products which specifically focused on one ingredient products to aid targeted areas on one's skin. Unlike other brands *The Ordinary,* does not focus on its marketing and advertising approach, yet their minimalist approach of marketing the brand does not fail to catch the eye of skincare and ingredient savvies for healthy skin.
