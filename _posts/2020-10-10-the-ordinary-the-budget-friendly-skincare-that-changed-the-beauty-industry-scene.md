Clean Beauty has become a focal point of one's skincare. Whether that ranges from Korean 10 step skin care to skincare savies using Paula's choice along with other ingredient dictionary websites skincare is important to consumers more than ever.

The focus on single ingredients that are effective is greater and research and knowledge of products we apply on our faces is absolutely crucial.

This is where *The Ordinary* comes in. On the need for clean and effective skincare, The Ordinary, as of 2016 managed to launch their skincare products at significantly low price points yet being transparent of their products which the skinacre industry had been lacking for a number of years.

Unlike other brands, who made a fortune every year, out of the marketisation of a product focusing on words such as 'glowy skin', 'clear skin', 'targeting acne prone skin', *The Ordinary* pioneered in creating affordable and high quality skincare products which specifically focused on one ingredient products to aid targeted areas of the skin.

*The Ordinary,* does not focus on its marketing and advertising approach, yet their minimalist approach of marketing the brand, still is an eyecatcher for skincare and ingredient list fanatics. But how have they been able to maintain such a strong profile without having a strong online presence? How does their brand retain the original values even after the growth of the company?

The colours that *The Ordinary* uses are minimalist which is indicative of the fact that the focus is based on the research and quality of the skincare rather than the creation of fancy and luxurious branding. The colours appear to be gender neutral as they range from black, white and grey yet the bold choices of colour show the scientific and serious nature of these products, which by no means does the company want to scare its audience away but rather help the consumer benefit to the maximum through the skincare line.

The typeface, *The Ordinary,* use is Raleway. It is a sans-serif typeface which potrays a simplicity and elegance. It is used for both the headings and body. Bold is used for headings as well as semibold for subheadings. Raleway Regular is used for the body copy and use light for the caprtions.

The tone of voice *The Ordinary* has are:

Friendly , Informative, Scientific, Clear and Concise, low- profile

*The Ordinary*'s skincare know their demographic whether that is individuals who know how to solve any issues when it comes to skincare due to their knowledge of ingredients and formulas one needs; or their second demographic who are new to the skincare world who's main concern is how reliable a product is. *The Ordinary*'s goal to create a trusted environment and casual yet insightful instruction when it comes to the use of their skincare range. 

Would you choose *The Ordinary* when creating a new skincare regimen?
