<p>Navigating between two cultures and countries, Holly Humphries-Tsioumi, a half-Greek half-English undergraduate is studying Media, Publishing and Journalism at Oxford Brookes University. Presently settled in Milton Keynes, England, Holly’s drive is to empower the sense of identity and comfort in one’s own skin through her TypeFace website.
</p>
<p>Raised from a Eurocentric perspective with noticeable divisions in skincare essentials has caused Holly to resolve this conflict by researching top skincare routines and products from all over the world. Holly strives to consolidate the best global knowledge to share with her readership. The impact of this research has made her recognise that skincare is more than what lies at face value and pursues natural beauty and optimal health which is more than just skin deep.</p>

<p>Further insight into branding and social media techniques used by differing manufacturers to exploit the target market has played a significant role in the website’s content development. </p>

<p>Through merging social media trends and the establishment of new products, Holly wants to share the global knowledge of skincare on one platform by focusing on products that are: organic, unique, fresh, youthful and relevant.</p>
